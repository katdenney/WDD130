                My purpose is to share recipes that I frequently make.Busy and health-conscious people are my target audience.
                [What is this website?
                This website shows a couple of our favorite recipes with pictures and instructions. The home page introduces the recipes, and you can find each recipe in the navigation bar with photos and some instructions.
                Who is this website for?
                I created this website with health-conscious mothers in mind, but it would be helpful to anyone looking for a couple of healthy recipes that take little time to prepare.  
                Sweet Green 
                The Sweet Green smoothie is a green smoothie that is stacked with fiber and micronutrients. The sweetness comes from green grapes and liquid stevia. It has ginger to aid digestion, cucumber that inhibits the activity of pro-inflammatory enzymes, and celery that contains 1.6 grams of insoluble fiber per cup. Fiber fosters a diverse and healthy gut microbiome, balances cholesterol levels, and prevents blood sugar spikes.
                Arugula Tuna 
                The Arugula Tuna salad balances tuna, arugula, and cucumber. Tuna is low calorie and high protein while rich in omega-3 fatty acids, potassium, manganese, zinc, vitamin C, iron, vitamin B, and selenium. Omega-3 fatty acids support the health of our heart and, when combined with potassium, have anti-inflammatory effects. Manganese, zinc, vitamin C, and selenium support our immune system, while iron and vitamin B help with blood circulation. Arugula is an excellent source of antioxidants, and cucumber gives us anti-inflammatory benefits.
