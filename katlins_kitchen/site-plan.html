        [What is this website?
        This website shows a couple of our favorite recipes with pictures and instructions. The home page introduces the recipes, and you can find each recipe in the navigation bar with photos and some instructions.
        Who is this website for?
        I created this website with health-conscious mothers in mind, but it would be helpful to anyone looking for a couple of healthy recipes that take little time to prepare.  
        Sweet Green 
        The Sweet Green smoothie is a green smoothie that is stacked with fiber and micronutrients. The sweetness comes from green grapes and liquid stevia. It has ginger to aid digestion, cucumber that inhibits the activity of pro-inflammatory enzymes, and celery that contains 1.6 grams of insoluble fiber per cup. Fiber fosters a diverse and healthy gut microbiome, balances cholesterol levels, and prevents blood sugar spikes.
        Arugula Tuna 
        The Arugula Tuna salad balances tuna, arugula, and cucumber. Tuna is low calorie and high protein while rich in omega-3 fatty acids, potassium, manganese, zinc, vitamin C, iron, vitamin B, and selenium. Omega-3 fatty acids support the health of our heart and, when combined with potassium, have anti-inflammatory effects. Manganese, zinc, vitamin C, and selenium support our immune system, while iron and vitamin B help with blood circulation. Arugula is an excellent source of antioxidants, and cucumber gives us anti-inflammatory benefits.

      <h3>[Sweet Green Smoothie]</h3>
      <p>
        [The Sweet Green recipe 
        1 cup mixed baby greens (kale and spinach)
        1 cup frozen diced celery 
        1 cup frozen diced cucumber 
        1/2 cup frozen green grapes 
        1 Tbs frozen diced ginger 
        1 tsp liquid stevia 
        3 cups water (more if a thinner consistency is desired)
        I buy my ingredients fresh then I wash and prep them before freezing. Freezing these ingredients means I can purchase larger amounts from a wholesaler for a lower cost and use them daily over months rather than buying them fresh in small quantities weekly. I wash and peel the ginger before dicing. For freezing the ginger, I have two solid methods; the first is I measure the diced ginger and fill ice cube trays with one tablespoon per ice cube space, filling to the top with water. After I freeze these ginger ice cubes, I store them in a freezer-safe container. An alternative to this is laying the diced ginger flat on a cookie sheet to freeze on parchment paper. After the diced ginger is frozen, it can be stored in a freezer-safe container. I only buy and prep ginger every six months, so using it daily is not a hassle. With all the ingredients pre-prepped and frozen, this smoothie takes less than five minutes to make. I combine all the ingredients in a blender with water and blend. Blend until smooth, and what you have is a wholesome nutrient and fiber-dense smoothie that will leave you refreshed and energized.

      <h3>[Arugula Tuna Salad]</h3>
      <p>
        [Arugula Tuna Salad
        3.5 oz can of tuna 
        2 Tbs apple cider vinegar 
        1 Tbs olive oil
        juice of 1 lemon 
        1/4 tsp salt 
        1/4 tsp pepper
        1/4 tsp onion powder 
        1/4 tsp garlic powder 
        1 Tbs sprouted pumpkin seeds 
        1 Tbs fat-free feta cheese 
        1 medium-sized cucumber, diced 
        4oz arugula 
        To start, I combine the can of tuna (drained) in a medium size bowl with apple cider vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, and seasonings, then mix it until it is very well combined. I dress the arugula with a little extra oil, vinegar, and salt before I lay it down in a flat dish and top it evenly with the tuna mixture. After the tuna is evenly distributed atop the arugula, I sprinkle the cucumber, feta, and pumpkin seeds on top to garnish.
